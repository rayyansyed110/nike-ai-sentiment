I will not fail because of me. I will fail because Nike won’t release enough of these lol
I love everything about this- I wish Tom Sachs would take over the ACG line- the ACG models used to be so much better than the ones that are currently out. I feel like they were over designed in the past.
"It’s supposed to be about the Mars Yard, but mostly is about endless amounts of talent and perseverance, and about one of the most compelling storylines in the history of fashion. We want a pair 🥺"
Standing by for this release 🤞
"“…Nike Craft is for everyone else.”
So we made only 5000 pairs."
"Haven't been this excited for a pair in years, what a great video and story!"
"Work is the constant, challenges are the work. I’m here ready, with failure never an option."
Ready to work for them as long as we’re not fighting bots 😂
I need one of these for every new shoe. Ja2s and Jordan 40s would be super cool.
So so so incredibly stoked! Let summer camp begin!!
"Love the thought and mission here. As an artist myself, I really appreciate what you’re creating. Hoping my luck’s good enough to get a pair."
The reward for good work is more work couldn’t ring truer here
Van Neistat would have crushed this video.  Can’t wait for the shoe!!!
The one shoe I’ve been chasing for years. Hopefully I can get this one.
It's a shoe. Nike made it appear like they were creating a spacecraft.
"Love it. Even now improving, just as with us, every day is learning day."
"let’s goooooooooo!! i’m so hyped, will def be copping as many pairs as possible, i legit wore my 2.0’s until they feel off my feet 🙏🙏🙏🙏"
Love the  vision. Love the shoe. Hate how limited and hard they’ll be to get.
If I take an L on the drop I'm coming directly to you Tom and do as many push-ups to failure as possible
Manifesting a pair. I need them and will wear them everyday proud
"They won’t, and you know it"
 @eddolous how many would be enough?
There’s someone who knows what’s up.
Find success in that failure
"""if you want them, you're going to have to work for them."" tell that to the resellers."
If it was for everyone then it would be for nobody. Nike knows what they are doing.
High art is an insurance scam for the rich. Scammers scam...
Casey and Van definitely got inspired from Tom when they work for him before.
My first though. This is Casey on Steroids. But Sachs came first I get it.
He was in it!
3 and a half then
Tom is a special talent. Hoping to get my hands on a pair of these!
"Can’t wait for the opportunity to make this my everyday shoe.. Mr Sachs, how do we make this happen."
Love it! So Let’s work for it 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 let me know what to do 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
good to see him dressed up
Hope they make about 4M pairs so we can all have a good shot of buying for retail 🤞🏽
"Please release a new GPS, my current favorite shoe."
Truly amazing story
Would love to be able to get my hands on these!
Great video! hope to get a pair!🤞
I went to Govenors island for the 2.0 release. It was amazingz
Can't wait!
I sold mine after all the news about how he’s treats his workers
Great video! Feels like a Casey Neistat film! I need a pair of these!! What we gotta do Tom!!?!
I need these 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Got me hyped for a pair! What a great history on the development and failures along the way.  When can I earn myself a pair?!  Let’s go!
Only 37 pairs will be available for release 🤣 thinking about it too I wish they would put this much effort in this video in making more pairs available for everyone
"this would be the best iteration 

i see his vison"
I feel like this is a perfect Casey Neistat video.
"Accepting assignments Nike & Tom, tell me what I need to do & I’ll do it"
Knowing Nike will only make 15 of this collab & make everyone fight with the resellers & celebrities 😭.
I'm sure you made a pretty good profit
Want a cookie?
An everyday shoe that only hype beasts and resellers can get...
"such a good mini doc. its wild because I can see where Casey Neistat gets his inspiration from, the great Tom Sachs."
I love creatives like this lol
We need more general purpose shoes please
No wonder he never understood the females saying no… my guy saw it as a game 😂 we developed a rich dialogue saying no to each other
Brilliant!
KING SOLOMON 👏🏽
Van Neistat is smiling right now
offer letter is available at the newest post and comment section
"How disappointing that I'll be leaving the US end of July and missing the drop. Only to be traveling to Vietnam, the place of the shoes production where it won't release 😅"
Nike returns to tel stories finally
my all time nike shoes.. love it
Give us another Overshoe 🙏🏾🙏🏾
"So cute this brief history! So brief that hasn’t even had the time to adress all the abuse and bad persona of this creation genius, isn’t it? After all, all is forgotten and forgiven…"
Will find a way to get these and work them to the ground in the ORs
"Mars yard is awesome, probably won't hit. I would be satisfied just to get more general purpose shoe colors"
cool guy. i enjoyed this.
It’s a cool looking shoe!
"nike FREE trail called, they want their SFB back ;)"
Love this so much! For my space/design nerd self!
Dude 😂
Wow
Awesome !
RESPECT...
:D Next level marketing
Love the story behind it all
Can't wait to put in the work!
Let’s go!
I need a pair or 2
Yes because going to the bodega or down anacostia in dc is going to a different world
Had a coworker that had a pair. Nobody knew what they were. I always complimented him when he wore them. It's one of the shoes you have to know if not you may think it is a pair of brown free runs.
idgaf where can I BUY THESE OUTERBOOTS TEHYRE SO COOL
I need a pair. Tom is different
Its real help nike shoes 👟 in a details ❤
Beautiful video
Hope I get a pair for myself and wife. Love my gps trainers.
Sound from film TeneT !?
"nice story, it's gonna be hit 🎉"
Welcome Back Tom!
Tom is forever 10 years old inside. We should be so lucky.
Please do let me know what work I need to do.

Good😊
Welcome back? You know some People are in jail for what he did ?
Is this advert audience the Vikings only😮😮😮 ?
"man just make enough of them, i'll do a 100 push ups in a nike store for them if thats what i gotta do lol"
INCREDIBLE.
I like the video
I want to get it! form 🇯🇵
But how does one sign up to work for them?
🇲🇽🇲🇽🥳
This was fantastic. Makes me even more excited to do the challenge app!
Hey Nike when he said “for everyone else” does that mean you’ll actually make enough pairs for everyone!
Let me get a pair
Can I get the 2.5 please 🥺
So how do we work for them?
Nike Nicolas ✅
respectfully now you know.
Just tell me what I gotta do
SO F'N DOPE !!! 🚀💨💨 Let's Go ‼️
Nike shoes nice for sport
"I passed the test last mars yard and wasn't able to get a pair, still hurts today."
I am ready to put in the work.
"The Tom Sachs Nike Shoe. 

Van Neistat has prepared me for this day."
Unfortunately no lol.
Let's go to work.
Perfect shoe for the rich middle aged mamas boys who think they are different
everyday shoe huh? falls apart you say? well make more and make them accessible.
"Nike ACG is making a comeback, just sayin'"
“there’s nobody here”
NEED these
❤❤🚀
Trade you a painting for a pair?!
General release that
ほしい！ほしい！ほしい！
I’m sick on not getting them when they drop. Hey Nike how about send me a pair for all the L’s I’ve taken over the years!
Need these 3.0 stop playing @nike
"The studio made me think of Casey Neistat, is it just me ?"
Am i the only one who doesn't understand?

i will do the work
"So? I can't buy your 'CUTE' Mars Yard, but I'll Buy TSLA or SPACE X - XOVR. Let's GO To THE MARS."
"Is stupid in 2025 to heave a sport shoe made from plastic, hard to get,very expensive ,heavy  😢"
Ohhhhhhhh yeaaaaaa
"NIKECRAFT Wear Tester reporting for duty, ready to get to work"
the painted-on swoosh looks like a downgrade
👀
Let’s work hard.
What's even the point of the utility product if most people can't get it??? I'm not buying it. This is pure marketing bluffs....
How do you know they will be TTS?
Need 1 pair definitwly
When's the release date?
"never sleep on Tom, always be knolling"
How did they allow so much cursing? Especially the F word...
17 minutes of NOTHING... Has anyone figured out what this man does for a living?
🚀🪐❤️
IT WON’T FAiL BECAUSE OF ME.
$275 USD :D Hahahhaha

Nike model = magarina  응 나이키 잘가. 극우 묻은 거 용서 안해^^^
