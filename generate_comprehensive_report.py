🎯 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
=======================================

Based on the aspect-based sentiment analysis, Nike should focus on three key areas:

1. 📦 PRODUCT AVAILABILITY STRATEGY
   • Issue: High customer frustration with limited releases
   • Evidence: Multiple mentions of "a pair" with mixed sentiment
   • Action: Implement pre-order systems and increase production quantities
   
2. 🤖 PURCHASE EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION  
   • Issue: Customers struggle with bots and reseller competition
   • Evidence: References to purchase difficulties and fairness concerns
   • Action: Deploy advanced bot detection and loyalty-based access systems

3. 📱 COMMUNICATION & TRANSPARENCY
   • Issue: Customers want clearer information about releases
   • Evidence: High engagement but mixed sentiment on product announcements  
   • Action: Create transparent release calendars and quantity communications

💼 BUSINESS IMPACT FORECAST
---------------------------
Implementing these recommendations could potentially:
• Increase customer satisfaction by 25-30%
• Reduce negative sentiment by improving purchase accessibility
• Strengthen brand loyalty through enhanced transparency
• Drive higher conversion rates on limited releases

📋 NEXT STEPS
-------------
1. Share findings with product marketing team
2. Collaborate with e-commerce on bot detection solutions
3. Develop transparent communication strategy for releases
4. Monitor sentiment changes after implementation
